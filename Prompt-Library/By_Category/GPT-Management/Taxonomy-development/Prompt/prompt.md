# Improve my GPT management system

## Summary:

I'm currently developing a system (built on NocoDB) for recording prompts, prompt outputs, and custom GPTs. I find GPT to be very helpful in helping me to ideate ways for further improvement - such as datapoints to connect with "relationships", new fields to capture, etc. It is helping to make the system thorough and robust.
